<b>Keynote 1:</b> <br>

Prof. Qiong Huang (South China Agricultural University, China)<br><br>

<b>Talk title:</b> Domain-Specific Fine-Grained Access Control for Cloud-Edge Collaborative IoT<br><br>

<b>Abstract:</b>
 The cloud-edge collaborative data sharing supporting data confidentiality can be realized by adopting outsourced Attribute-Based Encryption (ABE) schemes. Yet, most existing schemes in such kind of scenarios are facing challenges such as vulnerable terminal devices that are easy to be attacked, lack of flexible authorization management methods for a large number of devices, and lack methods to securely specify on-demand data sharing domains. In this paper, we propose a Domain-specific On-demand Access Control scheme with fully Independent Revocation (DOACIR), which not only realizes a three-layer on-demand data sharing framework for cloud-edge collaborative IoT environments but also allows data uploader to restrict the data sharing domain through a succinct way. The attribute authority and multiple edge servers perform data access authorization collaboratively to improve the data sharing efficiency as well as avoid the key-abuse problem and key-leakage problem. We further extend the scheme to support cross-domain data sharing, namely Cross-Domain DOACIR (CD-DOACIR), by improving the encryption phase allowing data uploader to specify any number of sharing domains while the size of ciphertext remains constant. <br><br>

<b>Keynote 2:</b> <br>

Dr.  Guomin Yang (Singapore Management University, Singapore)<br><br>

<b>Talk title:</b> Privacy Enhancing Technologies for IoT and Decentralized Systems: Approaches and Challenges <br><br>

<b>Abstract:</b>
Due to the fast evolving of computer and communications technologies and the increasing demand for user and data privacy, privacy enhancing technologies have gathered a lot of attention and been extensively studied by the cybersecurity community. This talk will review the challenges in building privacy-preserving solutions for IoT and decentralized systems from trust, privacy, usability, and accountability perspectives, followed by some recent proposals aiming to address those challenges. The talk will also discuss some gaps between the theoretical advancements and practical applications of the new technologies.

<b>Keynote 3:</b> <br>

Dr. Feng Lin (Zhejiang University, China)<br><br>

<b>Talk title:</b> Security for Cross-modality Acoustic IoT: Attack and Defense <br><br>

<b>Abstract:</b>
Acoustic security is paramount in today's digital era, particularly as device interconnectivity accelerates through the Internet of Things (IoT). By protecting personal and confidential information, it upholds privacy and cultivates trust among users¡ªkey components for the continued evolution and uptake of voice-driven technologies. Expanding beyond traditional acoustic monitoring, cross-modality sensing enables the conversion of data across wireless, electromagnetic, and visual signals into auditory information. In this presentation, we will explore cutting-edge research in cross-modality acoustic security, tackling both offensive and defensive strategies. We will delve into the nuances of speech injection attacks and its defense, wireless side-channel eavesdropping, and multimodal authentication techniques.

Keynote</b><br>
Prof. Zhiqiang Lin (The Ohio State University, USA)<br><br>

<b>Talk title:</b> Rethinking the Security and Privacy of Bluetooth Low Energy <br><br>

<b>Abstract:</b> Being a near range wireless communication technology, Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) has been widely used in numerous Internet-of-Things (IoT) devices from healthcare, fitness, wearables, to smart home because of its extremely lower energy consumption. Unfortunately, the past several years have also witnessed numerous security flaws, from implementation (e.g., leaking UUIDs) to specification (e.g., downgrading attacks) that have rendered billions of Bluetooth devices vulnerable to attacks. While luckily these flaws have been discovered, there is no reason to believe that the current Bluetooth Low Energy protocols and implementations (even with all those fixes enabled) are free from attacks, since Bluetooth Low Energy consists of multiple layers with various sub-protocols and components.
<br><br>
In this keynote, Dr. Lin will talk about a number of recently identified security and privacy threats against the BLE, and the lessons learned from those threats. In particular, he will first discuss the protocol-level downgrade attack, an attack that can force the secure BLE channels into insecure ones to break the data integrity and confidentiality of BLE traffic. Then, he will discuss how the current threat model of BLE fails and why it is time now to rethink the security principles in the design of BLE. Next, he will introduce Bluetooth Address Tracking (BAT) attack, a new protocol-level attack discovered from his group, which can track randomized Bluetooth MAC addresses by using an allowlist-based side channel. He will discuss the lessons learned, root causes of the attack, and its countermeasures.  Finally, he will conclude his talk by discussing future directions in Bluetooth security and privacy.
